# Android app to collect medical data

Android app to collect data to be analyzed for medical purposes. Its development was started as part of a final degree project at [UCM](https://www.ucm.es) which can be found here: [System to predict bipolar disorder crises analysing massive data by Ana María Martínez](http://eprints.ucm.es/38722). This mobile app is being used in the project [Bip4cast](http://www.bip4cast.org), in which data of patients from the [San Juan de Dios hospital](http://www.nuestraseñoradelapaz.es) is being collected with the objective of improving the treatment of the bipolar disorder whose crises that can be avoided through early prediction.

**Bip4cast.apk** can be used to install the last stable version of the app in your Android device. Screenshots of the application in a device with Android 6.0.1 can be seen in [screenshots](https://github.com/Ana06/medical-data-android/tree/master/screenshots) and [screenshots_ES](https://github.com/Ana06/medical-data-android/tree/master/screenshots_ES). Also, a video of the app in the same device can be seen in the following link: [https://youtu.be/InZCw9WAZzI](https://youtu.be/InZCw9WAZzI).

[Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/tools/studio/index.html) is being used to develop the app. The [Android Developers guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html) was used for writting the code.


## Prototyping

The folder [prototype_ES](https://github.com/Ana06/medical-data-android/tree/master/prototype_ES) contains images of a prototype of the app done with [JUSTINMIND](http://www.justinmind.com). Also, two prototype videos of how the app will work can be se#en here: [Daily use](https://youtu.be/rmyIEO8Utz8) and [Registration](https://youtu.be/yqyoxoveptU). Take into account that the prototype was done at the beginning of the development of the app and there are some differences between the app and the prototype as some changes has been introduced.
